  <h3 id="about">About Open ONI</h3>
  <p>The Open Online Newspaper Initiative (Open ONI) is a collaborative, open-source software platform for providing online access to digital newspaper content. An extension of the LC Newspaper Viewer (chronam) software developed by the Library of Congress for the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP), a partnership between the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Library of Congress (LC), Open ONI strives to provide an accessible platform for states and local organizations to make keyword-searchable digital newspaper content freely available to the public online. Supported by a community of heritage institutions across the United States, this rich digital resource will be developed and permanently maintained by contributors and users within the community. Contributor institutions include the University of Oregon, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Pennsylvania State University, University of South Carolina, Paul Smith's College, LYRASIS, Northern New York Library Network, Digital Public Library of America, Stanford University, and the North Carolina Digital Heritage Center.</p> 
  
  <p>Open ONI is designed to work with newspaper materials digitized to technical specifications set by the Library of Congress. These specifications include the following basic elements (profiles describing the full set of specifications can be found at <a href="http://www.loc.gov/ndnp/guidelines/">http://www.loc.gov/ndnp/guidelines/</a>) : </p>
  <ul>

  <li>TIFF 6.0, 8-bit grayscale, 400 dpi, uncompressed, with specified tag values</li>
  <li>JPEG2000, Part 1; 8-bit component; 6 decomposition layers; 25 quality layers; 8:1 compression; with XML Box with specified RDF metadata</li>
  <li>Single page PDF with hidden text; downsampled to 150 dpi, using JPEG compression; with XMP containing specified RDF metadata.</li>
  <li>Single page machine-readable text encoded in ALTO, v. 2.0 XML; in column-reading order (created with Optical Character Recognition).</li>
  <li>METS XML data objects describing newspaper issues, pages, and microfilm reels; incorporating elements in MODS, PREMIS, and MIX formats.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Open ONI is designed to provide access to these digitized materials primarily through a Web interface enhanced with dynamic HTML interactivity for magnification and navigation. Searches are available for full-text newspaper pages. Pages are displayed in JPEG format, dynamically-created from source files on user request and presented through the browser interface using a combination of Javascript, DHTML and AJAX Web programming.</p>

  <h3 id="preservation_data_repository_and_dissemination_application">Preservation Data Repository and Dissemination Application</h3>
  <p>Open ONI is based on the Open Archive Information System (OAIS) Reference Model for preservation repository architecture and supported by a variety of modular components to enable long-term sustainability of data ingestion, archival management and data dissemination. The public website is built using the Python programming language, Django Web framework, RDFLib, Apache Solr search server, Apache Web server, and MySQL database engine.</p>
