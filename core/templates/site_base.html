  To customize the look and feel of your installation, create
  a new "site_base.html" file in the appropriate theme 
  (themes/your_theme/templates/site_base.html) and override blocks of code
  from "site.html" as desired.

  All of the templates should be building off of this template, so
  there is no need to alter "site.html" nor to duplicate it in new themes.
