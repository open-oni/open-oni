### Migration
Make sure you read *all* Migration notes from whatever release you're running
through this release!  This final release changes so little that there are no
notes here, but if you're coming from 0.10, for instance, you really need to
look at all migration notes from 0.11 and on!

## [v1.0.0-rc.2]
[v1.0.0-rc.2]: https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/compare/v1.0.0-rc.1...v1.0.0-rc.2

## [v1.0.0-rc.1]
[v1.0.0-rc.1]: https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/compare/v0.13.0...v1.0.0-rc.1

### Fixed
- Reindex no longer crashes when indexing pages with no images
- IIIF APIs no longer crash on pages that don't have images
- Replace `url.netloc` with `url.hostname` in `settings_local.py` so sites
  running on a nonstandard port will still work (this wouldn't be typical in
  production, but could happen for development and staging servers)

### Added
- Documentation previously on wiki and inline code moved into `/docs` directory
  - Organized into subdirectories and provided links for discoverability
  - Minimally updated documentation for current docker setup
  - Documented all supported management commands, with a particular emphasis on
    common tasks like batch loading and purging.
- CONTRIBUTING.md from "Contribute" and "Development Standards" wiki pages
  - Release checklist
- Pull request template
- Dependency Roadmap and Resource Requirements in README.md

### Changed
- Update tablesorter JS library to 2.31.2
- Add Bootstrap classes on skip link for better cross-browser compatibility
  - Remove simpler CSS rules applied to `skiplink` class
  - Retain `skiplink` class for backwards-compatibility and customization
- Page reindexer no longer deletes pages prior to reindexing them, to avoid
  downtime when reindexing large sites
- Clean up Docker Apache config
- `robots.txt` disallows `/data/` for all user agents rather than a short list

### Removed
- `core/utils/__init__.py`, which overrode `strftime` with
  `django.utils.datetime_safe`'s `strftime` and provided alias `strftime_safe`
  for Python 2's inability to handle dates prior to 1900. Python 3 handles dates
  from 1000 on consistently.
- `scripts/` directory with PyMarc test script

### Migration
- Update code using `strftime` or `strftime_safe` from `core.utils`
  - For DateField model instances, e.g. `issue.date_issued`
    - Remove any imports from `core.utils`
    - Change
      - `strftime(issue.date_issued, date_format_string)` or
      - `strftime_safe(issue.date_issued, date_format_string)`
      to
      - `issue.date_issued.strftime(date_format_string)`
  - For non-DateField model instance objects
    - Import `date`, `datetime`, or `time` from `datetime`
    - Make `datetime` and `time` objects aware of the timezone to avoid warning
      messages with:
      ```python
      from datetime import datetime

      from django.conf import settings
      from django.utils.timezone import make_aware

      dt = datetime.now()
      dt = make_aware(dt, settings.TIME_ZONE)
      ```
    - Call the method on your object as `dt.strftime(date_format_string)`
- Make sure you use replace `url.netloc` with `url.hostname` in your
  `settings_local.py` if you have problems with hostnames!
- If you use the reindexer routinely (`./manage.py index` or `./manage.py
  index_pages`), and were reliant on the behavior of deleting the indexed page
  data, you'll want to change your approach to first run `./manage.py
  zap_index`.  The new behavior deliberately does *not* delete pages
  implicitly.

### Deprecated
- `manage.py` admin commands:
  - `batches`
  - `commit_index`
  - `delete_cache`
  - `link_places`
  - `purge_etitles`
  - `reconcile`

## [v0.13.0] - Open ONI components all using supported versions
[v0.13.0]: https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/compare/v0.12.1...v0.13.0

This pre-release lays the foundation for Open ONI 1.0, to be released this
spring. Major components are now all using supported versions:
- Python 3.6 (Supported until 2021-12)
- Django 2.2 LTS (Supported until 2022-04)
- MariaDB 10.4 (Supported until 2024-06)
- Solr 8.3 (Supported until 10.0, estimated 2022 with ~18-month between major
  releases)

We expect Open ONI's major components to be supported until the next Django LTS
release 3.2 in April 2021, at which point we will likely upgrade Open ONI's
components between major releases again.

### Changed
- Upgraded to Solr 8.3 - this includes our docker-compose setup as well as the
  way Solr is configured
  - The schema.xml and solrconfig.xml files have been removed in lieu of using
    the Solr 8.3 APIs to define fields and field types
- `SOLR` setting now derived in `core/apps.py` [initialization
  customization](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/applications/#django.apps.AppConfig.ready)
  from user-facing `SOLR_BASE_URL` setting
- Moved more internal settings derived from user settings to `core/apps.py`
- Combined IIIF URL settings into a single env-configurable URL setting
- Upgraded to MariaDB 10.4 for docker-compose users

### Removed
- Solr configuration files have been removed, as mentioned in the "Changed"
  section
- Docker: Apache file-based caching for /images/resize requests

### Migration
- If you're using docker, upgrade your MariaDB database:
  - `docker-compose exec rdbms mysql_upgrade -p123456`
- If you're using docker, rebuild your ONI image: `docker-compose build`
- Docker developers will need to destroy all test volumes and the local test
  docker image or tests will not pass:
  - `docker-compose -f ./test-compose.yml -p onitest down -v --rmi=local`
- Review settings changes:
  - Rename `SOLR` to `SOLR_BASE_URL` and remove `/solr/openoni` endpoint path
    in `onisite/settings_local.py`. See example file for reference.
  - `RESIZE_SERVER` and `TILE_SERVER` are replaced by `IIIF_URL`,
    which may be set with the environment variable `ONI_IIIF_URL`
- You will have to reindex all your data, which could take a long time, so
  prepare in advance!
  - **Note**: if you defined fields or altered configuration in Solr manually,
    you will need to determine how to do this using the APIs, and possibly set
    up something manual rather than using the script (`setup_index`) mentioned
    below.  If you feel like ONI needs a different configuration, please send
    us a PR explaining what you feel should change, and why.
  - Docker developers (production docker users should consider the cost of
    downtime and decide if this approach is feasible / acceptable):
    - Take the stack down: `docker-compose down`
    - Remove the old solr data manually: `docker volume rm open-oni_data-solr`
    - Restart the stack: `docker-compose up -d`
    - Reindex data: `docker-compose exec web manage index`
    - For advanced users: note the new solr data location in `/var/solr`
      instead of `/opt/solr`.  If you have docker overrides related to the solr
      data mount, make sure you change it!
  - Bare metal:
    - You may have to remove Solr entirely and then manually install Solr 8.3
      - It's possible to run Solr 6.6 and Solr 8.3 side-by-side in order to
        simplify the migration and reduce / eliminate downtime, but the steps
        for doing so are out of scope here as this can be a rather advanced
        operation, and can vary greatly depending on one's current setup.
    - Update your ONI config to point to the Solr 8.3 instance, if it has
      changed
    - Start Solr 8.3, and when it's ready, set it up with our configuration and
      then reindex your data:
      - `cd /opt/openoni`
      - `source ENV/bin/activate`
      - `./manage.py setup_index`
      - `./manage.py index`

## [v0.12.1] - Hotfix
[v0.12.1]: https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/compare/v0.12.0...v0.12.1

### Changed
- Changelog for v0.12.0 was missing some steps, making migrations from v0.11.1
  and prior significantly more difficult than necessary

### Removed
- The docker-compose "onidata" volume was unnecessary and made migrations from
  v0.11.1 and prior appear to have data loss (they didn't), so it has been
  removed and the system reconfigured to not expect it

### Migration
- If you're coming from v0.11.1 or prior, the notes in v0.12.0 will suffice
- If you're coming from v0.12.0, and using docker, you should destroy your
  volumes and reingest all data
  - Our docker-compose setup is intended for development, not production, so
    this shouldn't pose a problem, but if you have been using docker in
    production, please ping us on [our slack
    channel](http://bit.ly/openoni-slack-signup) for assistance migrating.

## [v0.12.0] - Python 3 and Django 2.2 upgrades
[v0.12.0]: https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/compare/v0.11.1...v0.12.0

### Fixed
- Sitemap Apache alias paths
- Added empty `log/` directory to prevent errors when not present
- Database connection was missing option to always set strict mode

### Changed
- All code in ONI core, including the default theme, has been migrated to work
  with Django 2.2 LTS
  - Django 2.2 only supports Python 3
    - Python 2 code will no longer work anywhere in the stack: plugins, themes,
      core overrides, etc.
  - The docker setup installs a much newer Ubuntu server as well as Python 3.6
- Docker-compose changes:
  - MariaDB and Solr ports are no longer forcibly exposed to the host
    - If you need these, use a `docker-compose.override.yml` file
  - Batches must now live under `./data/batches`, not `./docker/data/batches`
    for ingest
    - This fixes odd issues which can occur when mounting over an existing
      mount point (we mount `.` as `/opt/openoni`, and previously were mounting
      `./docker/data` as `/opt/openoni/data`, effectively shadowing the actual
      data directory)
  - All generated ingest artifacts now live in a named volume, `onidata`, which
    is mounted into multiple containers as `/var/local/onidata`
- Updated `docs/` CentOS 7 documentation
  - Reorganize for a more linear reading to configure everything
  - Add Python 3 mod_wsgi documentation
  - Move database migration step after defining settings
- Updated WSGIDaemonProcess directives in `conf/apache/django.conf`
  - Added WSGI `python-home` and `python-path` options
  - Set `processes` to 8 for production directive
  - Moved server-wide Apache directives to `docs/services/apache.md`

### Removed
- All Python 2 support / compatibility
- The concept of "released" batches has been removed to reduce confusion:
  ingested batches become part of the system regardless of their "released"
  status, and are simply not displayed on the (undocumented) `/batches` list.
  This is extremely confusing and not terribly helpful, so we've opted to
  simply remove the feature entirely.  All batches are now live upon ingest
  (which, again, they always were, it just wasn't terribly obvious).

### Migration
- Remove your `ENV` directory entirely - it will be full of Python 2 code you
  no longer need, and while it shouldn't conflict, some of our automations
  don't happen if the `ENV` directory is already present
- If you're using docker, rebuild your ONI image from scratch:
  - `docker-compose build --no-cache`
- If you use any of our plugins, make sure you look over their repositories and
  get a version that is built for Django 2.2.  Django 2.2 only supports Python
  3, so plugins which work with Django 2.2 will work with Python 3.
  - Plugins built by the ONI team should generally include compatibility
    information in their README; here's [our calendar plugin's
    information](https://github.com/open-oni/plugin_calendar#compatibility), for
    example.
- `settings_local.py` and `urls.py` will need to be changed.  There are modules
  which no longer exist in Python 3, which we used in those files in Python 2.
  The easiest approach is to simply re-copy the example files and alter them,
  assuming you haven't had major overrides to settings.
- Custom themes and plugins you've built will need to be fixed for Django 2.2,
  and therefore Python 3
  - Exact fixes are out of scope for ONI, but you can learn a lot from:
    - The [Python porting
      documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html)
    - The [2to3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html) tool's
      documentation
    - The [Django upgrade
      documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/upgrade-version/)
  - Most themes and plugins will need minimal work to get updated, but complex
    Python code could require a lot of migration effort
- Move your local/development batches and word coordinates into `./data` if you
  previously had them in `./docker/data`

### Deprecated
- [Django Deprecation
  Timeline](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/internals/deprecation/)
- MariaDB and Solr will be upgraded for Open ONI 1.0, so existing databases and
  Solr indices will have to be repopulated

### Migration

Migrating to v0.11 requires special attention to a lot of changes.  Read this
carefully before attempting a migration, and it may behoove you to read over
the [Django upgrade
notes](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/upgrade-version/) if your ONI
instance has a lot of custom code.

- Rewrite your settings **from scratch**.  The new
  `onisite/settings_local_example.py` file should help guide you, but enough
  has changed this release that you can't just copy your old settings and
  expect things to work!
- If you were using a `docker-compose.override.yml` file, update its version to
  2.1
- Django 1.8 to 1.11
  - [Update use of (Request)Context objects passed to `template.render` calls at
    the end of code in view
    definitions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/templates/upgrading/#get-template-and-select-template)
  - [Import `django.utils.deprecation.MiddlewareMixin` in middleware and pass
    `MiddlewareMixin` to middleware class
    definitions](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/commit/c51d7235d47690884da00a794c3f522933579925)
  - Remove import of `django.conf.urls.patterns` from `urls.py` files
  - [Replace `render_to_response` with `render` in view
    code](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/commit/c40ca4eb87a47865c1d88cb92d3b9d316cea277f)
  - [Convert `optparse` to `argparse` in custom management
    commands](https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/commit/37854ea135ce011add09040de06506c794e130d0)
- Tablesorter update for `newspapers.html`
  - Add `sort-titles` class on <th> element to toggle use of title sort parser
    which ignores articles "a", "an", and "the"
  - Add `sort-off` class on <th> element to disabling sorting by column(s)
- Review updated `__base.html` and default theme `__overrides.html` to mimic
  inclusion of favicon and default page author + description
  `<meta>` tags
- Update skip links and return to top links to target `#maincontent`

### Deprecated
- Django 1.8 to 1.11
  - [Full deprecation
    timeline](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/internals/deprecation/) for
    reference
  - Use of `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`, to be removed in Django 2.0
- Python 2's end of life is coming soon, and Open ONI will *no longer
  support it* after this release

- Freezes dependencies to fix a problem where new installs would simply not work
  due to missing python libraries
- Updates advanced search to put "Search Terms" above "Proximity Search" based
  on user feedback

[v0.8.0]: https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0

Adds "proximity" searching back into the advanced search, and improves
accessibility with the search results pagination

## [v0.7.0] - 2017-10-25 - Bug fixes
[v0.7.0]: https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0

Multiple bugs have been addressed:
- The "about" page, when the first or last issue wasn't digitized, no longer
  crashes
- The "page number" in advanced search was never working and has been replaced
  with a checkbox to choose front pages only
- The selected titles, from advanced search, now persist when refining search
  results
- The "jump to page" functionality no longer loses various search filters
- Various other "refine search" persistence problems have been addressed

## [v0.6.0] - 2017-09-21 - New languages support, universal viewer support, mariadb
[v0.6.0]: https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0

This is a big back-end release:
- We've now got Solr configured to support a bunch of new languages instead of
  just the four or five we had from the chronam fork.
- We've updated the docker setup to use mariadb instead of mysql (you'll
  probably want to dump your MySQL database and import it into MariaDB).
- Last, but definitely not least: there is now significantly better support for
  IIIF systems like the Universal Viewer!

## [v0.5.0] - 2017-09-07 - Bug fixes

[v0.4.0]: https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0

Highlights finally work properly (we think)!! Also, skip links work better,
there's an easier way to run tests locally via docker, and Apache log level is
configurable by an environment variable.

[v0.2.2]: https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2

Removes the solr and mysql optimization as a default step when purging batches,
as it can take a very long time with large datasets. Optimization can still be
done by adding `--optimize` to the purge command.

## [v0.2.1] - 2017-08-11 - Image URL bug fixes
[v0.2.1]: https://github.com/open-oni/open-oni/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1
