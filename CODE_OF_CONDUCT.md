## Introduction
Like the technical community as a whole, the Open ONI community is made up of a
mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication
issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask
people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors and those
seeking help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Open ONI organization.
This includes [Open ONI
Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/open-oni/shared_invite/enQtMzg5MDg5NjU5MDU2LTA4MmViOTkxZDliZWZmM2FlMGU5ODZjNDU0OWQxYzIzMTY1YmFlMWEzZDFkNDNjZmYxYzUyMmMwZjlkMjU1MGE),
[Open ONI GitHub](https://github.com/open-oni/), and any other forums created by
the project team which the community uses for communication online or in person.
In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's
ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please see
[Reporting](#reporting) below.

## Open ONI Community Health Team
This is the team of individuals who have volunteered to respond to violation
reports and enforce this code of conduct. Please contact any and all members
with code of conduct inquiries and violation reports.

## Expected Behavior
- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
  people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to
  members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration
  status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation,
  gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
  religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
  colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
  decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be
  communicating in someone else's primary language.
- **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
  no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel
  uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Open ONI
  community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with
  people outside the Open ONI community.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of
  professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do
  not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
  behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
    information ("doxing").
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then
    stop.
- **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time and Open ONI is no exception. It is important
  that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember
  that we’re different. The strength of Open ONI comes from its varied
  community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have
  different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds
  a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to
  err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping
  to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## Reporting
If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report
it to one or more members of the Open ONI Community Health Team either via email
or [Open ONI
Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/open-oni/shared_invite/enQtMzg5MDg5NjU5MDU2LTA4MmViOTkxZDliZWZmM2FlMGU5ODZjNDU0OWQxYzIzMTY1YmFlMWEzZDFkNDNjZmYxYzUyMmMwZjlkMjU1MGE).
If you are reporting a violation by one or more of the team members, only the
other team members will be informed to review and respond to the report. In the
event of any conflict of interest a team member must immediately notify the
other members, and recuse themselves if necessary. All reports will be kept
confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need
to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will
remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please consider notifying
appropriate law enforcement first.** If you are unsure whether it is necessary
or what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your
report. The team may consider contacting law enforcement if deemed appropriate
based on the report.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space
where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still
report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take
no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look
negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about
incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help
us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

In your report please include:
- Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
  were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
- When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
- Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record please
  (e.g. a GitHub issue/PR comment) include a link.
- Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
- If you believe this incident is ongoing.
- Any other information you believe we should have.

### Acknowledgement
You will receive a message from the Open ONI Community Health Team acknowledging
receipt. If you provide an email address for contact, the response will cc all
team members, excluding any members who may be reported for possible violation,
for greater transparency. We promise to acknowledge receipt within three
business days (and will aim for much quicker than that). Our acknowledgement
response will include an estimated time for full response based on team
availability (illness, vacation, conferences, etc) and complexity of the report
(number of individuals, time span, availability of public evidence, etc). Team
members will aim to communicate availability through email auto-replies and
Slack status messages.

The team will meet to review the incident and determine:
- What happened.
- Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
- Who the bad actor was.
- Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's
  physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
the team's immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This means
we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the situation has
ended and that everyone is physically safe.

If a report doesn't contain enough information, the team will obtain all
relevant data before acting by contacting any individuals involved to get a more
complete account of events. This information will be collected in writing, and
whenever possible the committee's deliberations will be recorded and retained
(i.e. Slack transcripts, email discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc).

### Acting Unilaterally
If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment in Slack), or
involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any team member
may act immediately (before consulting other members) to end the situation. In
ongoing situations, any team member may at their discretion employ any of the
tools available to the team, including bans and blocks.

If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the team may act
unilaterally to protect safety. This can include contacting law enforcement or
other local personnel.

In situations where an individual team member acts unilaterally, they must
report their actions to the team for review within 24 hours. These unilateral
actions will then receive accompanying violation reports.

### Response and Enforcement
Once the team has a complete account of the events they will make a decision as
to how to respond. Responses may include:
- Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
- A private reprimand from the team to the individual(s) involved.
- A public reprimand in the space the violation occurred.
- An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from Slack or
  GitHub). They'll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don't
  agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation.
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Open ONI spaces. The team will
  maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future,
  extended to new Open ONI fora, or otherwise maintained.
- A request for a public or private apology. The team may, if it chooses, attach
  "strings". For example, the team may ask a violator to apologize in order to
  retain their membership on a Slack channel.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account
feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response and record it
for posterity, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.

Finally, the team will compile a summary of the situation and may choose to
release a public report of the incident.

### Transparency
After the beginning of each new year, the team will publicize the number of
violation reports received and the team's enforcement decisions for the previous
year. Any public incident reports will be listed and linked to as well.
